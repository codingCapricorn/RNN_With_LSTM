Neural networks are set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of human brain.Recurrent Neural Networks are the first of its kind State of the Art algorithms that can Memorize/remember previous inputs in memory, When a huge set of Sequential data is given to it.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. LSTM’s have a Nature of Remembering information for a long periods of time is their Default behaviour.Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!
